In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible. Add oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour. While the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside. When the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles. Place half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one. I added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies. Wet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure. Use the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies. Bake for 20 minutes. Makes 10-12 mini pies (depending on the size of your cookie cutter. Mine was about 3  inches wide)"

Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large ""gumbo pot"" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John. Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called ""dead man,"" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo). Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh. Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer. Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time. Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so. Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot. Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat. Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove. To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time."

Once it is all mixed together stick your saucepan in the freezer while you chop the nuts and prepare the ice cream maker. Chop the almonds.

Once you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on. Set your timer for 35 minutes.

Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms. Place a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape. Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper. Dip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets. Stand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.) Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones. *Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes."

Set aside for at least 10 minutes. Pour porcini water in a pot, salt the water, and bring to a boil. Stir in farro, lower heat to a simmer and cook until water is gone, about 40 minutes. Farro should be al dente yet tender. You can add more or less water and cook until desired softness. There's plenty of leeway and personal preference with farro. While farro is cooking, saute chanterelles for several minutes in butter in a large skillet, in batches if necessary. Avoid slimy chanterelles by not crowding the pan. You want the mushrooms to be lightly browned and firm. Stir mascarpone into farro, then stir in most of the chanterelles, reserving some as a topping. Season and garnish with chopped chives or parsley."

Set aside. To make the sauce: Cut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more. Using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate. To prepare the corn dogs: In a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away. When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces. Roll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili."

Stir in the vanilla, molasses and egg, combine thoroughly.  Mix in the dry ingredients gradually until the dough is smooth. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half until its about 2 inches around, like a log.  Wrap each log in plastic wrap and then roll them lightly to smooth them out.  Refrigerate or freeze until firm. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment. Slice the dough into 1/4 inch rounds with a serrated knift being careful to keep their shape. Place the rounds on the baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated or course sugar. Bake for 10-13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time.  Let the cookies cool in the pan for about 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack. Dough can be refrigertaed for up to five days or frozen for up to three months.  Baked cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for approximately a week. To assemble the sandwiches: (Im sure this is a no-brainer, but.you never know.) Thaw the ice cream until soft enough to scoop.  Because of the high water content from the pumpkin puree it tends to freeze very firmly. Take one scoop of ice cream and place on top of one gingersnap, using a second cookie place on top of the ice cream and gently press down."

This recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark. Stir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour. Prep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper. Punch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes. Oil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400F(200C). Take the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife. When done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes. This bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!"

Depending on the size and shape of your bowl you may need a little bit more buttermilk in order that the chicken is covered. Cover with some cling film and place in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Remove before frying to give enough time to bring the meat up to room temperature. 2.In a dish or bowl combine the flour, half teaspoon of salt, smoked paprika, thyme and pepper. Combine with your fingers or a fork. 3.Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and dispose of the marinade. Shake off most of the drips and then dredge the chicken in your flour mix making sure each piece is covered completely. 4.Heat about 1.5cm / 0.5 in. of oil in a heavy bottomed wide pan. While this is heating up you can get a wire rack ready to drain the chicken. I do this by placing kitchen paper over the rack. 5.The oil temperature should be about 170C / 340F for frying. I dont check with a thermometer but by putting a piece of bread in the oil and it is ready when it fizzes and turns brown quickly. The time the oil takes to heat up will depend on the thickness of the metal of your pan, your stove top and the quantity of oil you have used. 6.You will probably have to cook in batches so as not to over load the pan. I start with the thighs which need a little bit more time than the legs. Place each one carefully in the pan and fry, covered, on a good strong simmer for anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes on each side. The heat needs to be high enough to give you a nice brown colour and a crisp finish. Remove and set on the rack to drain. Then do the same with the legs, giving them a couple of minutes less than the thighs."

Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely. Prepare the simple syrup glaze by placing all of the ingredients in a small pot and bringing to a boil. Boil about 3 minutes and remove from heat. Set aside to cool. Prepare frosting by beating the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl until creamy and lump free. Add half the whipping cream and beat on low about 30 seconds. Add half the powdered sugar and beat until all the sugar is mixed in. Add remaining whipping cream and beat until creamy. Add the last of the powdered sugar and beat well, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract and beat for about 30 seconds. Turn the mixer on high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Assemble the cake Trim any uneven parts off the top of your first layer by sawing a serrated knife along the top until the top is level. Place on a cake stand or plate. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with an even layer of the simple syrup.  Trim the second layer of cake and place on a cooling rack. Brush with simple syrup and set aside. Discard any left over syrup. Allow syrup to soak into the cake layers for about 5 or 10 minutes. Spread about a cup of frosting over the top of the first cake layer to about a  inch from the edge. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the frosting to about an  inch from the edge of the frosting. Carefully place the second layer of cake on top of the first layer being careful not to put too much pressure on the filling. You dont want the filling to start to ooze out from the sides of the cake. Take about 1 cup of frosting out of the bowl and put it into a smaller bowl. This is to prevent the chocolate crumbs from the cake to get into the bowl of frosting. You dont want flecks of cake in your white frosting. Spread a thin but even layer of frosting on the sides of the cake. Be sure to fill the space between both cake layers with frosting. This will trap the filling between both cake layers. Frost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Chill for about an hour to set the frosting. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top. Form an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake. You may have to even out the frosting in the center by removing a thin layer  of frosting until the edges are higher then the center of the cake. Add cherry pie filling to the top filling in the center of the frosting. Chill before serving."

Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable. 2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde. 3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside. 4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside. 5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot. 6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit. 7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides. 8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used. 9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end. 10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't. 11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes. 12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm."

Gather the wonton wrapper with the filling in the palm of hand and squeeze gently while folding the wrapper skin upwards and against the filling so that the wonton wrapper wraps the filling tightly. Make sure the dumplings are tight. Otherwise they may fall apart while being steamed. Use more water to seal them if necessary. Place a large shrimp on the top of each pork siew mai. Add a few pieces of chopped carrot or salmon roe or salted egg yolk to add a fresh colour to the dumpling. Do the same for the glutinous rice siew mai, adding more lap cheong pieces on the top if preferred. Place the dumplings in a steamer lined with baking paper. Cut some holes through the baking paper to let the steam through. Place the steamer over boiling water for 14-15 minutes or until the filling is cooked. Serve hot. Uncooked dumplings may be frozen and steamed at a later date. Dust some flour in a container so that the dumplings wont stick to it."

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.</li><li>Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  Place the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li><li>Remove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.</li><li>Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.</li><li>Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.</li></ol>"

Buckwheat Galette With An Egg,10,45,https://www.foodista.com/recipe/QF2D46MW/buckwheat-galette-with-an-egg,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/636393-556x370.jpg,85.49,4.24,2.07,8.17,"1 cup of milk (I used 2%%), 1/2 tablespoon a of sugar, a pinch of sea salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, melted, 1/4 cup of buckwheat flour, 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour, 2 smalls eggs, 2 Eggs (for the topping)","Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight. In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around. Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan). Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries. Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped. I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily. To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm. So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg. When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate."

In a sauce pan,let the butter melt.When it has just about melted, add the honey, whisk the two to an emulsion.Dont cook. Preheat oven to 400F.Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or silicone mats. I think aluminium foil will not work. Slowly add the butter-honey mix to the flour-sesame mix and start combining with a spatula. You might need little less or more honey mix if your flour is chunky or fine. The mix once done will resemble a loose cookie dough [but not runny] Spoon a dollop [approx 1 tbsp] of the mix on the parchment paper.Dip a fork in oil & flatten out the mix with the help of the back of the fork. Bake in oven for 8 -10 minutes or until the crisps are brown.You really need to keep a watch on these coz they cook really fast. Once done,take out of the oven and if you want, use a cookie cutter while still warm to a desired shape. Let the crisps cool before stacking them in air tight container."

In the meantime, dry roast the cinnamon stick, black cardamom seeds, green cardamom seeds, pepper corns and cloves. Pound them to a powder (not very fine). In a mortar and pestle grind the green chillies to a paste. (Using a pinch of coarse salt will help) Mix all the ingredients together and your marinade is ready. Ensure that you pat dry the chicken cubes. Transfer the chicken in a bowl Add the marinade to the chicken cubes and mix it well so that all pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl with a cling film and put it in the refrigerator. Leave the chicken to marinate over-night. (I marinated for almost 18 hours and the result was moist and tender chicken tikkas) For Grilling: I grilled these tikkas in my non-stick grill pan. Using a non-stick pan helped me keep the amount of oil to minimal. Soak the skewers in water for at least half an hour before you intend to serve them. Now take the skewers and start skewering the chicken pieces on them. I leave a little space in between the chicken pieces; else they stick together and do not get cooked well. (Perhaps the reason could be pan grilling) Keep the skewers ready and then heat the pan (medium hot). You can use an oil spray or pour a little oil using a spoon in a linear fashion across the grill pan. Place the skewers over the oiled pan and grill them on medium low heat. It will take approximately 45 seconds to a minute for one side to get cooked. Then turn around and cook the other side the same way. Serve them hot as a starter or as a main course with Bakarkhani!!

Once the spinach is cooked, add to the spinach, wheat germ, parmesan cheese, Mexican (the original recipe called for cheddar) shredded cheese, chopped pecans, and finely diced green onions. Mix until combined. Add in salt, a touch of pepper, and dried basil, to taste. I used about  teaspoon of dried basil, but feel free to use as much as you like. The sisters also suggest adding nutmeg, to taste, if you like! Once the mixture is seasoned to your liking, add in two eggs and water and mix again until the eggs have been fully incorporated! Now stuff the mixture into each of the shells. You should have enough of the spinach filling to make about 16 - 20 shells. Set these aside. Take an 8 x 8 pan (you could also use a 9 x 13) and grease it with cooking spray. Now spread alfredo sauce on the bottom, you'll use about  of a jar. Spread spaghetti sauce on top of that. Use a spatula to spread it evenly on the bottom of the pan. Top the sauces with the shells. Use the remaining sauce to top the shells. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven, uncovered, for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and serve!"

Now the rest of the meal will take less than 25 minutes: 10 minutes to boil the pasta, make the sauce, and assemble the dish (and, if youre like me, some sub-urb biscuits), and 15 minutes to bake it (while you make  a quick salad).  So be ready. I melt my butter in my wok over high heat.  I throw my pasta nests into the salted boiling water on the back burner. When my butter is melted and just begging to tan, I add my heavy cream and blend well.  I bring this to a simmer for a moment. Then I add 3/4 of my cheese, which Ive shredded. (The rest I will thinly shave for a final garnish.) I blend this well, bringing it to a low simmer to thicken, until it forms a smooth sauce.  I also add some salt and pepper.  (Crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, paprika, maybe even a dash of curry powder would work nicely here, too.) Finally, I add 3/4 of my cooked bacon, and blend well with the sauce, until the flavors are beautifully infused. Its  been 10 minutes, and my 11 minute pasta is just slightly undercooked (I know, cuz I bit off a snippet)  perfect!  Using tongs and a meshed spoon, I transfer my pasta to the waiting bacon cream, and toss well.  I add a tablespoon, maybe, of the pasta water, too, just to keep the sauce wet enough to bake later. Using my tongs, I spin 1/2 of the pasta and sauce into each of two medium (10oz) ceramic ramekins, which Ive brushed down with melted butter.  I sprinkle most of the rest of my bacon (reserving a few chunks for a final flourish) on top. The piece of resistance: a whole, cracked, raw egg, dropped into a wee basket I left in the middle of my pasta and sauce nests.  I manage to keep the yolk whole only in one, but the other I rather hold together by virtue of a cleverly placed noodle and some dribbled sauce.  I place these into a 350 oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the whites have set, but the yolk is still glossy and runny. After coring the best bits out of a loaf of bread destined for nothing (since my husband purchased a fresher loaf of preferred pan this afternoon) with a properly sized wine-glass rim, I brushed each disk with melted butter, and layered them with some of my sprinkled cheese into 4 cups of a buttered muffin tin, and then I stuck them in my oven along with my pasta nests to brown.  I consider these my sub-urb Wonderbread biscuits: quick, easy, and yummy, leaving fodder for crotons (or compost).  I also threw together a quick salad of baby greens, sliced onion, strips of roasted red peppers, black olives, EVOO, and salt and pepper.  Not that dinner needed these accoutrement  my simmering, saucy noodle nests of runny yolk baked eggs, bac"

After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times.

Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!)

Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool. Rolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin."

If using a baggie, snip off about 1/4"" of the corner and squeeze baggie to pipe out mousse into the hollowed section of the zucchini. Stop short of the end by about 1/2"", as the ricotta will expand when baking. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese along the top of flutes.

Wrap the meat tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days. (The sauce was really thin and liquid-y so after dumping about half on the meat and realizing massaging was just not going to happen, I threw the meat and the sauce into a ziplock bag, shook it up and made sure it was coated then threw it in the fridge for the three day marinating marathon.)</li><li>At least one hour prior to cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator and unwrap, placing the meat and the marinating juices into a disposable 913 disposable aluminum pan and let it come to room temperature. (As I mentioned above, my pans were a bit flimsy so I doubled up.) Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.</li><li>Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled halfway with charcoal (about 3 quarts) and allow to burn until the coals are partially covered with a layer of ash. Build a modified two-level fire by arranging all the coals over half of the grill, leaving the other half empty. Open the bottom grill vents completely. Place the wood chips on the coals. Set the cooking grate in place, cover and heat the grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean. Sip a wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding the wad with tongs, oil the cooking grate.</li><li>Set the aluminum pan with the roast on the grate opposite the coals. Open the grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, making sure the vent is above the meat to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about eight briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275F for three hours. (When I added coals, I also basted the marinade over the roast to ensure moistness.)</li><li>Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325F. Wrap the pan holding the roast, being careful not to spill the marinating liquid, with heavy duty aluminum foil to cover completely. Place the pan in the oven and cook until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li><li>Carefully slide the foil-wrapped pan with the roast into a brown paper bag. Crimp the end shut. Let rest for 1 hour. (I found it easiest to lay the paper bag open on its side and slide the roast in, instead of dropping it downward, then folding the opening up and taping it shut.)</li><li>While roast is resting, prepare barbecue sauce. If wanting true South Carolina style barbecue sauce, make the marinade above. If wanting a thicker, tangier sauce with a hot finish, I highly recommend Inas barbecue sauce below. Its a bit of an ingredient dump with 11 of 13 items being from jars and bottles, but with flavors so loud and clamoring for your taste-buds attention, you wont regret it.</li><li>In a large sauce pan on low heat, saute onions and garlic with the oil until the onions are translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 30 minutes. Use immediately or store in fridge. Makes about 6 cups.</li><li>Keeping: This sauce freezes excellently. I made a big batch last fall and froze it, pulling it out for the pulled pork. I re-heated in a sauce pan on low heat until hot.</li><li>Once pork has rested, transfer the roast to a carving board and dispose of the marinade liquid and pan. When cool enough to handle, separate the roast into sections, removing fat if desired, and tear the meat into shreds with your fingers (forks work just as well without your fingers getting messy). Place the shredded meat in a large bowl. Toss with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce, adding more to taste. Serve, passing the remaining sauce separately.</li></ol>"

Saut until the onion slices are lightly caramelized and the apples have begun to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the wine or other liquid. Return chops to the pan. Cook until the pork is tender, about 15 more minutes (depending on the size of the chops), turning halfway through and covering the chops with the apple mixture. Serve the chops over rice or mashed potatoes with a large spoonful of the apple-onion mixture over the top. Easy suggestion: replace the onion with leeks or add a sliced potato. You can deglaze the pan with beer, cider, chicken broth, or even water."

Coconut Flour Pancakes with Blueberry Honey Compote,1,30,http://www.foodista.com/recipe/NQD2H3RC/coconut-flour-pancakes-with-blueberry-honey-compote,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/639769-556x370.jpg,753.33,37.83,18.36,92.84,"2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, 3 tablespoons coconut flour, ¼ cup coconut milk, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon olive oil (or 2 tablespoons melted butter), 1 pinch Salt","<ol><li>Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water.  After about 3 minutes, checks on the blueberries  once juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well.  Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally.  The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot.  If youre looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan.  This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm.</li><li>While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter.  In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together.  Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and youre left with a very thick batter.  If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes.</li><li>Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet.  Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about a third of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet.  Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape.  (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch. Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.)</li><li>Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes. Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to break coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe).  Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat.</li><li>Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioners sugar. If you are looking for more sweetness: drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes.</li></ol>"

Whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and gradually add the wet ingredients. Mix everything together until combined. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Drop the batter by generous tablespoons, a few inches apart on the sheets (I recommend 5 per baking sheet). Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the shortcakes are just slightly golden. Allow the shortcakes to cool, then slice them in half with a serrated knife. Add a generous dollop of whipped topping to the bottom half, then a spoonful of strawberries on top of that. Top with the remaining shortcake half. Add a bit more whipped topping to the top of the shortcake, and spoon a few of the strawberries over it. Serve on individual dessert plates."

I improvised and used a plastic cap of a water bottle to cut out incomplete circles in the crust. While baking, the circles puffed out and shrunk, creating little peek-a-boo openings in the pie. Carefully transfer the top pie crust onto the top of the pie. Stretch out if necessary to distribute your patterns nicely. Using a rolling pin, press the pie crusts together to the rim of the baking pan, thus cutting the extras off without stretching the crusts. Bake for about 30 minutes at 425F, or until the egg and onion mixture is set in the middle, and pie crust is golden and flaky."

To get perfectly hard boiled eggs, once the water is boiling, add your eggs and set your timer for 9 1/2 minutes.  As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water. Once your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs. Now you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg. Take the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg. Roll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated. The final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty. Drop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks. Remove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil. Cut the eggs in half or quarters and serve while hot."

Place the graham crackers in a Ziploc bag, and with a rolling pin, crush them. My guy always comes around when it's time to do this, and does it for me. I think he likes it. In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the sugar. Add the melted butter, and mix well. Press the graham cracker mixture into a pie plate, and refrigerate for about a half hour. Now, the filling! Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar (and molasses, if you're using it). Keep the heat low, and stir until the brown sugar is all melted and bubbly. Add 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, and stir until the brown sugar and butter are dissolved. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, all of the milk, and the salt. Remove from heat, and let cool until lukewarm. I find this only takes about 10 minutes. Mix together the cornstarch and water, and pour it into the pudding mixture. Reheat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch! Turn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute. Remove from heat, and stir in the whiskey and vanilla. Whiskey wasn't in my original Butterscotch Pudding recipe, but I love the addition for this pie. Gives it a little extra somethin' somethin'. Pour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours. Ready for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout). Add the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum. I'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap. Pile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess! If you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate.

White Chocolate Cheesecake With Raspberries,16,45,,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/665172-556x370.jpg,287.7,18.33,10.63,28.51,"1 1/3 cups graham wafer crumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, 1/3 cup whipping cream, 1 cup good quality white chocolate chips, 3 ounces eight packages ounces cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 eggs, 3 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 cup whipping cream, 2 pints fresh raspberries","To make the crumb crust In a small bowl combine the graham crumbs, sugar and melted butter. Press into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.) To prepare the cheesecake In a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter. Cream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate. Finally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth. Pour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point. Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface) Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven). To finish the cheesecake When completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired. Chill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve."

Frost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Chill for about an hour to set the frosting. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top. Form an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake.

Pour the yolks and cream mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly being sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan.  Continue cooking until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Place some ice and water into a large bowl and place a smaller bowl inside. Pour the cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the bowl.  Stir in the pumpkin and vanilla, add the cinnamon stick back to the mixture. Chill thoroughly, preferably overnight. Pour the mixture into the freezer can of an electric ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions. In a small bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter untill soft.  Add the sugar and continue beating until smooth and creamy.  Stop the mixer occassionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the vanilla, molasses and egg, combine thoroughly.  Mix in the dry ingredients gradually until the dough is smooth. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half until its about 2 inches around, like a log.  Wrap each log in plastic wrap and then roll them lightly to smooth them out.  Refrigerate or freeze until firm. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment. Slice the dough into 1/4 inch rounds with a serrated knift being careful to keep their shape. Place the rounds on the baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated or course sugar. Bake for 10-13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time.  Let the cookies cool in the pan for about 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack. Dough can be refrigertaed for up to five days or frozen for up to three months.  Baked cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for approximately a week. To assemble the sandwiches: (Im sure this is a no-brainer, but.you never know.) Thaw the ice cream until soft enough to scoop.  Because of the high water content from the pumpkin puree it tends to freeze very firmly. Take one scoop of ice cream and place on top of one gingersnap, using a second cookie place on top of the ice cream and gently press down."

Once it is all mixed together stick your saucepan in the freezer while you chop the nuts and prepare the ice cream maker. Chop the almonds. I did a rough chop and tried to chop them different ways so you get a different size bite each time. Once you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on. Set your timer for 35 minutes.

Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour. While the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside. When the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles. Place half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one. I added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies. Wet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure. Use the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.

In a bowl, squeeze half of the Cara Cara orange and pulp, add salt and whisk together. Add in the radish and cucumber slices, arugula and toss together. For the scallops: heat oil in a high heat. Place the scallops flat-side down in the hot pan. Don't overcrowd the pan, or the pan won't stay hot enough to give the scallops a good sear. If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches. Once you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (Let them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip. Plate your salad and place 4 scallops on top.

Basil Coconut Ice Cream,8,45,https://www.foodista.com/recipe/CRN8C2B8/basil-coconut-ice-cream,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/634425-556x370.jpg,283.3,23.01,19.66,21.24,"1-1/2 cups fresh basil leaves (tightly packed), 2 cans full-fat coconut milk (13.6-ounce cans), ½ cup honey, ¾ cup half & half, 1/8 teaspoon salt","Heat coconut milk and cream on the stove over medium high in a saucepan until hot and barely bubbling (bring to a low boil). Add honey and salt; mix to dissolve. Add basil leaves, stir and allow them to wilt in the mixture; remove saucepan from heat.  Pour mixture into a blender and emulsify until completely creamy and no chunks of basil are visible (if this is not possible in your blender you can strain out the basil pieces with a fine wire strainer/colander if you would like or you can leave the basil pieces in the mixture).  Allow mixture to cool 20 minutes; this allows the flavors to infuse.  Pour mixture in a large container and refrigerate a few hours until cool. If using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly (the one I used sits on the counter. You just plug it in, turn it on chill mode, allow the built-in bowl to get cool, then pour in the ice cream mixture. You then turn on the churn setting and turn the timer on for 25 minutes.  It works its magic and you have wonderful ice cream by the time dinner is consumed). You can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the mixture in a freezer-safe container and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker, small ice crystals will form and the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but it will still be damn delicious! Side note: We had leftovers when I made this and we froze them in a Tupperware container. The ice cream gets to be frozen solid so when you go to eat the leftovers, make sure you thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in."

Add 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 teaspoon of fine sugar, add 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons of light soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing Huatiao wine. Place 100g of canned water chestnuts in a chopper/blender. Chop the water chestnuts to small pieces. Add the chopped water chestnuts to the pork mixture. If preferred, use spinach or cabbage in place of water chestnuts. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of finely chopped scallions or spring onions to the pork mixture. Combine all the filling ingredients well. Thaw the dumpling wrappers if they are frozen. Keep them well covered until they are ready to be used. Dust a dish generously with flour. This will hold the dumplings once they are made. Dust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling. Prepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper. Bring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet. Gently push the filling into the wrapper and pinch the top tip of the dumpling wrapper to seal it. From the centre of the dumpling, fold a pleat on ONE side and bring it to the other side of the dumpling. Fold towards the centre of the dumpling. Pinch to seal it. Repeat and create a 2nd pleat. Be mindful to pinch tight to seal the dumpling well. Repeat and create a 3rd pleat. Each side should have 3 pleats. Repeat the same pleating on the other end of the dumpling. Always ensure that the pleats face the centre of the dumpling. Place all prepared dumplings in a well floured dish ensuring that they do not touch each other. Set aside till ready to cook. They can also be frozen at this stage. To cook the potstickers, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan. The potstickers should be cooked in at least 2 batches. When the oil is hot, add the dumplings ensuring that the flat surfaces face down. Pan fry till the bottoms of the dumplings are a nice golden brown. Add 1/3 cup of water to the pan. Cover the pan immediately and let the steam cook the dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes. Once the water has evaporated, remove the cover and let the dumplings sit in the hot pan for another minute for its base to crisp up again. These are now Chinese potstickers. Gently transfer the potstickers to a plate. Serve immediately. These Chinese potstickers are best served with a vinegar dip made with balsamic or black chinese vinegar and thinly sliced ginger. Soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil may also be added to the dipping sauce."

Set aside. Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water. Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color. Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture. Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle. Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips. Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale. In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear. Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked. With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture. Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly. Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!"

When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute. Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt. When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times. When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour. When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough. Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.  Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce. Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish. This works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture. Try using pecorino cheese instead of parmesan"

Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.</li><li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>"

Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>"

Using cookie cutters, cut dough into shapes and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment approximately 1"" apart. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for one minute and move to a wire rack. In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Whisk to combine. Spoon mixture into a pastry bag or zip top bag and snip off the tip. Add two small dots of icing where the eyes should be and then press one eye on each dot.

Over medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.   Gradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.

Start by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender. While the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside. Clean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium. As the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes. While the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside. When the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing. Slice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink. Serve by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets. I like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese. Garnish with the orange zest. Trickle the vinaigrette over the salad. Best served immediately."

In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Remove any string-like particles from the chili pods. Add them to the boiling water along with half of a packet of Goya seasoning. Cover and let boil for about 20 minutes. Afterwards, place chili pods with 2 cups of the stock in a blender to coalesce. Drain the saucepan of the remaining stock and place back on the stove top. Return the heat to medium, and add olive oil once the remaining stock evaporates. Add onion and beef, and immediately begin to break apart the beef. Add 1 packet of Goya seasoning and chili powder, and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Add the chili sauce and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add garlic and 2 teaspoon salt. I added the poblano pepper at this point, but I should have added it with the beef and onion. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for one hour. For the last twenty minutes, partially cover the pan in order to slightly reduce. Most of the liquid should be reduced and thickened. In a large bowl, add instant corn masa mix, water, baking powder, salt, and olive oil to create corn masa mix. The mixture should be spongy. Whats surprisingly tricky is assembling the tamales. The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese. O cook, you should have a double boiler. If you dont, like me, then use a metal colander and place it in a large pot. Place the tamales in the colander (or double boiler) where they are not squished, nor are they loose enough to unravel themselves. While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water. Once water comes to a boil, reduce heat and add the tamales. Place a towel between the colander and lid, and cook for 30 minutes."

Add sugar; mix to dissolve. Remove from heat.  Pour mixture into a blender along with the chopped peaches. Allow mixture to cool about 10 minutes before pouring mixture in a large container; refrigerate a few hours until cold. If using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly. You can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the ice cream mixture in a freezer-safe container, placing it in the freezer and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but the ice cream will still be great! If you have leftovers in the freezer, thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in because it will be much stiffer than store-bought ice cream."

Press into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.) To prepare the cheesecake In a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter. Cream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate. Finally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth. Pour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point. Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface) Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven). To finish the cheesecake When completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired. Chill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve."

Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients using a spoon or spatula.  Batter will be somewhat lumpy -- do not over mix it to make it smooth.  Using an ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), fill paper liners.  Bake about 16 minutes, or till a toothpick inserted near center returns with just a few crumbs.  Cool in pan 5 minutes, then turn cupcakes out onto wire rack to completely cool.</li><li>PEANUT-BUTTER FILLING:  In small bowl, combine all ingredients.  Core cooled cupcakes with a Cuisipro or other hollowing device, and fill cavity with peanut butter filling.  Eat the cupcake pieces you cored; sandwich two with some peanut butter filling and marshmallow frosting.</li><li>MARSHMALLOW FROSTING:  In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring water, corn syrup and 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar to a rolling boil on high heat, brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush.  Do not stir mixture, as it will cause it to crystallize.  Boil until mixture reaches 242F, or soft-ball stage.</li><li>In the meantime, a few minutes after the sugar mixture comes to a boil, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl.  Using regular beaters on medium-high speed whip egg whites, vanilla powder or extract, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes.  With mixer still on, sprinkle the remaining 1 Tbsp. of sugar over the whites and continue beating until whites hold very soft peaks, another 2 minutes.  When syrup has reached 242F, reduce mixer speed to low.  Find the sweet spot (between the sides of the bowl and the beaters) and very, very slowly and carefully drizzle in the hot syrup.  After all syrup has been added, turn mixer to high and beat till thick, fluffy and just barely warm, about 7 minutes.  Fit a 16"" piping bag with a 1M Wilton tip; spoon frosting into bag and pipe onto cupcakes making high mounds of frosting.</li><li>GARNISHES:  Place chocolate into one bottom corner of a resealable plastic bag.  Microwave on high about 30 seconds.  Continue microwaving on high at 10-second intervals until chocolate is melted.  Very carefully cut the tiniest corner to make a very small hole through which the chocolate may be drizzled onto the frosting.  Lightly sprinkle peanuts over cupcakes.</li><li>TIME-SAVING TIPS:  Instead of making peanut butter filling, just use Peanut Butter & Co.'s White Chocolate Wonderful Peanut Butter.  If you're not lactose intolerant, you could use a cake mix for the cupcakes, but you will have to double the other ingredients.</li></ol>"

"Garlic and Herb Pork Roast With Potatoes, Wilted Spinach, and Cooling Cucumber Cream",10,45,https://www.foodista.com/recipe/NMVMGXHH/garlic-and-herb-pork-roast-with-potatoes-wilted-spinach-and-cooling-cucumber-cream,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/644227-556x370.jpg,479.13,21.67,4.53,25.34,"2 1/2 pounds boneless butterflies pork butt or shoulder, fresh oregano, fresh rosemary, fresh garlic, 1 pound baby spinach, 1 pound small red potatoes, 3 medium white onions, EVOO, white balsamic vinegar, Greek yoghurt, 1 medium cucumber, 1 lemon, sea salt, cracked black pepper","I pull the leaves off two sprigs of rosemary and two sprigs of oregano (about a loose 1/2 cup of herbage).  I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic. Along with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl. Then I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside. See?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm And get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface. Im going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down! Then cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown. I even brown each tip, like so. Finally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time. The house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check. Oh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a Oven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in. I make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing Then chopping my cucumber. I throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper And I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do. When my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend. I spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see. We purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept. I had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet. For the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp. Meanwhile, my onions have pickled And Ive layered my baby spinach over them Before I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan. I toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch. My pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender. This hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold. Topped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.  Light, fresh, and fantastic: I wish I could have you all over for dinner, because this was a company meal!"

Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot). Over medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot. Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish. Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper. Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle. Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings. After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes. Then over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Deglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes. Add the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes. Then place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone. After 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme. Remember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well. Add the Beef Short Ribs back to the pot of reduced Sauce and remove from the heat.  Coat the Short Ribs in the Sauce well.  Serve Immediately over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes or Polenta."

Dump the apples in and press them into the dough until they are evenly distributed and you have a nice round ball of dough. As with any bread, handle it as little and as quickly as possible or the scones will be tough. On a floured surface flatten the dough ball into a one inch thick disc.

Add 1 C of sugar. Add 1 C of vegetable oil. Heat it over a medium flame and stir till sugar has dissolved. Do NOT boil. Set the mixture aside to cool till lukewarm. About 38 deg C. Check with your finger right into the mixture. If its hot, then cool some more. I should be just very mildly comfortably warm to the touch. When the mixture is lukewarm, add 2 packets of instant dry yeast (about 16g, 4.5 teaspoons). Sprinkle the yeast on the surface of the mixture. Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes. If the yeast is fresh and alive, you will see it growing and poofing up. Add 8 C of plain flour. Mix it all up together. Dont overmix. Cover with a table cloth and set aside covered in a warm place for 1 hour. After an hour, the dough would have risen to twice its size. Punch the dough down. Add the last C of flour. Add 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder. Add 1 scant teaspoon of baking soda. Add 2 teaspoons of salt. Mix it up. Cover the dough again. And this time, either leave it in a warm place again for 1 hour. Or leave it covered in the fridge for 3 hours to rise slowly. Note: I left it in the fridge for 3 hours. The dough may be easier to manage when left to rise this way instead as it will be colder and harder. After the mentioned time, the dough would have risen again. Punch it down. Knead the dough for a few moments and then transfer the dough to the working table that has been lightly floured. If the dough is too wet at this stage. Chill it in the fridge for a while. Itll help. Flour a rolling pin. And roll out the dough into a huge long rectangle. Cut the dough into 2 parts. So that there are two long pieces of dough. Pour 2 cups of melted butter onto the rolled out dough. Note: Check your dough. If its VERY wet, reduce the amount of melted butter added at this stage. When the rolls are laid out in the pan later, pour the rest of the melted butter on them instead. I really prefer to add all the melted butter at this stage because the flavour goes right into the dough. Using fingers, evenly distribute the butter. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of cinnamon over the dough. Sprinkle 1 cup of castor sugar over the dough. Sprinkle 1 cup of brown sugar over the dough. As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers. Chop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans. Sprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough. Roll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll. If the dough is very wet and you are struggling to roll it, add some flour to the surfaces to help you roll. Cut into 1 inch thick rolls. Rub pans or baking dishes generously with more melted butter. Place the cinnamon rolls comfortably in each pan/dish. Do not overcrowd as they will expand alot in the pan. Pour remaining butter over the rolls. Dont be afraid! Set them aside for 1 hour. If theres wind/draft in your kitchen, cover the rolls with table cloths. The rolls will rise some more. Pop the rolls into a oven, preheated at 180 deg Celsius. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Dont get stressed about the proportions. Just mix the ingredients till you get a gooey consistency to pour over like syrup. Make a 1/4 cup of strong coffee with 1/4 cup water and one 3-in-1 coffee mix. Add 1 tablespoon of the best honey you can get your hands on. Maple syrup works too. Stir the honey into the coffee. Add a pinch of salt. Add 6 tablespoons of melted butter. Add 2 cups of icing sugar. Whisk it all up. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh cream. Stir in the cream. Pour the icing over the rolls while they are still hot."

Place the scallops flat-side down in the hot pan. Don't overcrowd the pan, or the pan won't stay hot enough to give the scallops a good sear. If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches. Once you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (Let them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip. Plate your salad and place 4 scallops on top. Scallops start to turn rubbery if you wait too long to serve them, so get them on the plate right away. And be sure to serve them with the beautiful caramel-colored crust facing up."

Now, the filling! Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar (and molasses, if you're using it). Keep the heat low, and stir until the brown sugar is all melted and bubbly. Add 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, and stir until the brown sugar and butter are dissolved.

It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch! Turn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute.

Pour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours. Ready for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout). Add the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum. I'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap. Pile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess! If you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate. I just took the carrot peeler to a Hershey bar. Or leave it plain. Either way! Enjoy!"
