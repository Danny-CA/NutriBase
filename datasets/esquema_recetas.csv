Line a baking tray with parchment or a baking mat. Combine water, milk, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir in flour quickly and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until mixture pulls away from sides of pan cleanly and forms a ball. Transfer dough into a mixing bowl and using an electric mixer, beat on low speed to cool slightly, about 3 mins. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 mins in the fridge. Dough may be stored, covered, for up to 24 hours in the fridge. Remove dough from fridge and fill into a piping bag. From this point on, you can pipe into rounds using a nozzle of your choice or cut a hole of about  1 1/2 cm at the tip of the piping bag and pipe into little logs of about 5 cm in length.... or longer if you want a bigger eclair. Bake in preheated oven for about 20 - 25 mins or until golden brown. Remove from oven and using the tip of a small knife (I used a chopstick), pierce a small hole to allow the steam to escape. This prevents the eclairs from going soggy on the inside. You can also do this step and place it into the oven for another 2 mins to dry it out. Allow to cool on a rack. PASTRY CREAM Place all ingredients into a saucepan and whisk until evenly combined. Place saucepan over medium heat and bring to a slow boil, stirring continuously. When mixture thickens into a paste, remove from heat. Transfer pastry cream into a clean, dry bowl and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Allow to cool and then place in fridge until fully chilled. Note: pastry cream will thicken slightly when chilled. Use within 2 days. When chilled, fill pastry cream into piping bag fitted with a tube nozzle and fill eclairs through the hole/slit you have made earlier. Dip or drizzle the top of filled eclairs with chocolate ganache. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. GANACHE Heat cream over medium heat in a saucepan until just about boiling. Do not boil. Remove from heat. Mix in chocolate pieces and stir until all chocolate has melted. Leave to cool. (Ganache will thicken when cooled). Can be kept in fridge. Remove and stand container in a bowl of warm water to soften before re-using."

Cover and cook until the clams open. While clams are cooking, drop the linguine into the salted boiling water and cook until the pasta is very al dente  maybe a minute or so less than the box directs.

Bring the liquid to a boil and toss in the cooked pasta and the herbs. Cook the pasta together with the sauce until the sauce clings to the pasta. Turn off the heat and toss in the grated parmigian-reggiano, if using. Stir vigorously to combine. Divide the pasta into serving dishes and garnish with clams that are still in their shells and some chopped herbs. Note: Purchase shellfish thats sold in mesh bags. If you buy clams or mussels that are in plastic bags, you may be getting dead shellfish. The plastic makes them suffocate."

Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time. Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so. Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot. Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat. Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove. To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time."

Once it is incorporated pull it off the heat and set it aside to cool. Add in the half and half, vanilla extract and heavy cream and stir well (I just used a regular spoon.) Once it is all mixed together stick your saucepan in the freezer while you chop the nuts and prepare the ice cream maker. Chop the almonds. I did a rough chop and tried to chop them different ways so you get a different size bite each time. Once you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on. Set your timer for 35 minutes. At the 35-minute mark add in your toppings and let it incorporate for another 5 minutes. Once this is done scoop it out of the ice cream maker and into your freezer containers.
